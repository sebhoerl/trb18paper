\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}

The study shows that the right choice of dispatching algorithm for an AMoD system
does not only have strong impact on the performance in terms of waiting times for
the customer, but also that it bears a significant economic advantage for the
operator. He is able to attract more customers through quicker pickups and
lower prices than a competitor with only little investment.

In order to assess the significance for real fleets of (not neccessarily
automated) taxis it needs to be noted that all of the presented algorithms are
able to process dispatching and rebalancing tasks for fleets of thousands of
vehicles within minutes. It is perfectly feasible to control 100k vehicles in
five minute updates using a standard laptop for the computational tasks.

For the presented simulations, this still poses a burden, though, because there
a speedup compared to reality of around one thousand times is desired to be able
to run large numbers of simulations with different parameters. Hence, the algorithms
could only be tested on a subsample of 1\% of the agent population that is available.
