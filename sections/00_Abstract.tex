The performance of different dispatching and rebalancing algorithms for the
control of an Autonomous Mobility On-Demand system is tested. The case study,
which is based on an agent-based simulation scenario of the city of Zurich,
shows, that the right choice of control algorithm not only minimzes customer
waiting times, but also offers large economical benefits for the operator.
For an average waiting time at peak hours of five minutes the most performant
algorithm would allow the operator to offer his service for around 0.45 CHF, which
is more expensive than using a private car today, but significantly cheaper than
a conventional taxi.
