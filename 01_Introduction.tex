\section{Introduction}

The rapid technological development in recent years has led to the point where automated vehicles are tested in various pilot projects around the world [citenutonomy, cite uber]. They promise to increase road capacity and speeds [cite tientrakool, friedrich] and would give access to mobility to formerly inhibited user groups (citeVictoria). On the flip side, an increase of vehicle
miles traveled (VMT) is expected due to empty rides, and the general increase of users may actually clog the roads even more than today, especially in the urban environment (cite Becker, Meyer). Hence, the overall effects on the transport system, environment, and society are unclear. Simulations, such as the one presented in the work at hand, can help to better understand the impact of vehicle automation and draw conclusions for the future.

A number of studies in recent years debated the feasibility of an autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) system (see Related Research). With such a system at hand, travelers would not need to own their own car but could call an automated vehicle [AV]
to pick them up at any location and bring them to their desired destination. For the customer, this would offer the comfortability of an individual taxi service for a fraction of today's cost. It is predicted that the costs of using the service on a daily basis heavily compete with privately owned cars and even public transit, depending on the use case [cite cost paper].

The success of an AV operator would depend on the pricing of his service as well as the wait and travel times that he is able to offer. While high prices may restrict the user group drastically, long wait times may have the same effect if they make traveling less predictable than before. Both quantities are inherently
linked by the way the fleet is operated: If wait times should be minimized, vehicles should be at all times present where the demand is expected. This, however almost certainly makes it necessary to relocate them without a passenger on board, which
directly translates to costs for the operator.

In the study at hand, we contribute to research around AMoD system as follows: We (a) present a simulation scenario of a fleet of automated taxis for Zurich, Switzerland, based on the MATSim framework, we (b) test and compare four different dispatching
and rebalancing algorithms for different fleet sizes, (c) analyze the results in terms of customer acceptance and (d) compare our results with theoretical predictions for fleet sizing.

The remainder is structured as follows: First, an overview of related search is given, then the simulation scenario and environment are introduced, as well as the proposed fleet control algorithms. Thereafter, simulation results are presented and
analyzed, followed by a discussion of our findings.
