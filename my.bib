It discusses autonomous vehicle benefits and costs, predicts their likely development and implementation based on experience with previous vehicle technologies, and explores how they will affect planning decisions such as optimal road, parking and public transit supply. The analysis indicates that some benefits, such as independent mobility for affluent non-drivers, may begin in the 2020s or 2030s, but most impacts, including reduced traffic and parking congestion (and therefore road and parking facility supply requirements), independent mobility for low-income people (and therefore reduced need to subsidize transit), increased safety, energy conservation and pollution reductions, will only be significant when autonomous vehicles become common and affordable, probably in the 2040s to 2060s, and some benefits may require prohibiting human-driven vehicles on certain roadways, which could take longer.},

@article{Truong2017,
abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) potentially increase vehicle travel by reducing travel and parking costs and by providing improved mobility to those who are too young to drive or older people. The increase in vehicle travel could be generated by both trip diversion from other modes and entirely new trips. Existing studies however tend to overlook AVs' impacts on entirely new trips. There is a need to develop a methodology for estimating possible impacts of AVs on entirely new trips across all age groups. This paper explores the impacts of AVs on car trips using a case study of Victoria, Australia. A new methodology for estimating entirely new trips associated with AVs is proposed by measuring gaps in travel need at different life stages. Results show that AVs would increase daily trips by 4.14{\%} on average. The 76+ age group would have the largest increase of 18.5{\%}, followed by the 18–24 age group and the 12–17 age group with 14.6 and 11.1{\%} respectively. If car occupancy remains constant in AV scenarios, entirely new trips and trip diversions from public transport and active modes would lead to a 7.31{\%} increase in car trips. However increases in car travel are substantially magnified by reduced car occupancy rates, a trend evidenced throughout the world. Car occupancy would need to increase by at least 5.3–7.3{\%} to keep car trips unchanged in AV scenarios.},

abstract="This paper extends a schedule-based transit assignment model to integrate vehicle sharing systems (VSS) with or without fixed stations permitting one-way rentals. It is assumed that travelers receive information through mobile internet on vehicle location and availability and that they can use a real-time booking service. The proposed model extends the functionality of a scheduled-based transit assignment in two ways: (1) It generates intermodal route choice sets combining transit and non-transit trip legs. This functionality enables an accessibility analysis to identify od-pairs benefiting from VSS. (2) It distributes a given travel demand on the route choice set considering capacity constraints of VSS. This functionality can be applied for an impact analysis of a proposed VSS.",
