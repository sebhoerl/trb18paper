%  UNPUBLISHED
%   Everything which is not going to be published.
%   Typical examples are presentations, internals (presentations,
%   seminars, org-meetings, tech-meetings, etc...), personal
%   discussions, etc...
%   it is NOT a paper which is going to be published somewhere, like
%   PhD-Thesis in progress, Tech-Reports, submitted papers of a conference
%   or a journal, etc...
%   Use the note-tag to specify the reference.

%  KEY-DEFINITION:
%    (Author1|Author1Author2|Author1EtAl)_unpub_(IndicationWhatItIs)_(YEAR)[_INDEX]
%    Example:
%      VovshaEtAl_unpub_EIRASS_2004,
%      Balmer_unpub_DVWG_2004
%      BalmerMeister_unpub_Hochschultagung_2005
%      CharyparEtAl_unpub_STRC_2006
%      VrticEtAl_unpub_IVW_2006
%  AUTHOR
%    If the author is known, use the crossref given in the author.txt
%    (add it there, if one is missing)
%    Sometimes there is no Author but an institution, organization or
%    simly the name of i.e. the software.
%    In this case, use that (without using a crossref).
%    Example:
%      AUTHOR = {{ARE}},
%      AUTHOR = {{MATSIM-T}},
%      AUTHOR = {{BfS}},
%  TITLE
%    Write the title in "Title-Style", the bib-style converts it.
%    If there are Characters which MUST be written as defined
%    (i.e. all-caps or no caps), then set those characters in
%    additional curly brackets.
%    Sometimes the title is--in fact--the organization. In this
%    case, use the crossref defined in ivt-ger.bst or ivt-eng.bst.
%    (add it there, if yours is missing)
%    Example:
%      TITLE =  org-ptv,
%      TITLE =  {Google Earth - Explore, Search and Discover},
%  YEAR
%    Always define a year:
%    Example:
%      YEAR =   {1981},
%  NOTE
%    Us the NOTE tag to specifiy the unpub-reference. Typically set
%    the type (i.e. presentation, internal, etc...) followed by
%    organization/institution, adress or similar information.
%    As far as possible, use the keys defined in the
%    translation.txt, (add additional there if needed).
%    Example:
%      NOTE =   unpub-intern # comma # uni-ethz-ivt # comma # uni-ethz # comma # zurich,
%      NOTE =   unpub-pres # comma # {Studentenbörse} # comma # org-dvwg # comma # berlin,
%      NOTE =   unpub-pres # comma # {Deutsche Hochschultagung Verkehrswesen} # comma # wildbadkreuth,
%  url
%    Optional: Add an url.
%    Example:
%      url =    {http://www.vsp.tu-berlin.de/publications/act-times/archive/results-maastricht-submitted-2004-03-08.pdf},
%  comment
%    Optional: add any comment you want
%    Example:
%      comment =      {balmermi: this is a very good one.},
