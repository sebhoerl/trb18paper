%  BOOK with Author or Editor
%    A book with an explicit publisher. NO Journals like TRR!
%    I.e. Arentze and Timmermans: "ALBATROSS: A Learning-Based
%    Transportation Oriented Simulation"; Bieger, Laesser and Maggi:
%    Jahrbuch 2002/2003 Schweizerische Verkehrswirtschaft; etc...s
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  KEY-DEFINITION:
%    if author is defined (means that those persons wrote the whole book):
%      (Author1|Author1Author2|Author1EtAl)_(YEAR|forth)[_(INDEX)]
%    if editor is defined (means that they edited the book, but others contributed papers to it):
%      (Editor1|Editor1Editor2|Editor1EtAl)_(YEAR|forth)[_(INDEX)]
%    Never define both!
%    Never define none of them!
%    Example:
%      Andersen_1997,
%      ArentzeTimmermans_2000,
%      ArentzeTimmermans_2000_3,
%      BiegerEtAl_2003,
%      BiegerEtAl_forth,
%  AUTHOR / EDITOR

%      EDITOR =    Axhausen,
%  TITLE
%    Write the title in "Title-Style", the bib-style converts it.
%    If there are Characters which MUST be written as defined

%    Optional. Write the volume number
%    Example:
%      volume =  {8},
%  series
%    Optional. Write the series
%    Example:
