%  INCOLLECTION
%    A part of a book with its own title. Therefore, the book WITH
%    EDITOR MUST exist in the book.bib!
%    NO Article in a Journal or magazine!
%    I.e. Axhausen in Jones (1990); Balmer et al. in Timmermans (2005);
%    Balmer et al. in Bieger et al. (2005); etc...

%  KEY-DEFINITION:
%    (Author1|Author1Author2|Author1EtAl)[_INDEX]_(BOOK-KEY)
%    BOOK-KEY is the key defined for the book the entry refers to.
%    AN INCOLLECTION ENTRY CAN ONLY REFER TO A BOOK WITH AN EDITOR.
%    A BOOK WITH AN AUTHOR DOES NOT HAVE OTHER AUTHORS WHICH WRITE
%    CHAPTERS!!!
%    Example:
%      Axhausen_Jones_1990,
%      BalmerEtAl_Timmermans_2005,
%      BalmerEtAl_BiegerEtAl_2005,
%  CROSSREF
%    MUST be the key of the book to which the entry refers to.
%    Example:
%      CROSSREF = {Jones_1990},
%      CROSSREF = {Timmermans_2005},
%      CROSSREF = {BiegerEtAl_2005},
%  AUTHOR
%    Must be crossrefs of authors given in the author.txt (add it there,
%    if one is missing)
%    Example:
%      AUTHOR =   Balmer # and # Raney # and # Nagel,
%  TITLE
%    Write the title in "Title-Style", the bib-style converts it.
%    If there are Characters which MUST be written as defined
%    (i.e. all-caps or no caps), then set those characters in
%    additional curly brackets.
%    Example:
%      TITLE =    {{PTV} Vision: Activity-Based Micro-Simulation Model for Travel Demand Forecasting},
%  chapter
%    Optional. Write the chapter number
%    Example:
%      chapter =  {5},
%  pages
%    Optional: Write the pages
%    Example:
%      pages =   {205--223},
%  comment
%    Optional: add any comment you want
%    Example:
%      comment =      {balmermi: this is a very good one.},
