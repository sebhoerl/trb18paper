<h3><a name="A"></a> A. The Form of a Bibtex Reference</h3>

<p>Bibtex references appear in the following format:</p>

<pre>@TYPE{KEY,
	FIELD1 = FIELDENTRY1,
	FIELD2 = FIELDENTRY2,
<b>	.
	.</b>
     }</pre>

<p>For a given type, each field is either required, optional, or
ignored. The text of a field must either be enclosed in double
quotes (i.e. &quot;field&quot;) or braces (i.e. {field}). These
quotes or braces may be optionally omitted around text consisting
entirely of numerals. If a field has multiple entries, for
example a book that is coauthored, the field should be entered
once and multiple names combined with &quot;and&quot;, as in
&quot;Bob Smith and Sally Jones&quot;. Currently, the Citation
system requires each field of a Bibtex reference to be on a
single line. Following is a list of each possible field:<br>
