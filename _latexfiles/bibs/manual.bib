%  MANUAL
%   A technical documentation.
%   Typically written by an institution, sometime there is an author.
%   It is NOT a TechReport!
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  KEY-DEFINITION:
%      (ShortFormOfContent|Author)_manual_(YEAR)
%    Example:
%      BIOGEME_manual_2005,
%  AUTHOR
%    If the author is known, use the crossref given in the author.txt
%    (add it there, if one is missing)
%    Sometimes there is no Author but an institution or organization.
%    In this case, use that (without using a crossref).
%    Example:
%      AUTHOR =       Bierlaire,
%      AUTHOR =       {{BfS}},
%  TITLE
%    Write the title in "Title-Style", the bib-style converts it.
%    If there are Characters which MUST be written as defined
%    (i.e. all-caps or no caps), then set those characters in
%    additional curly brackets.
%    Example:
%      TITLE =        {{R}egionales {B}ezugssystem ({RBS})},
%      TITLE =        {{COM}-{D}okumentation für {VISUM} 9.3},
%  YEAR
%    Always define a year:
%    Example:
%      YEAR =         {1981},
%  organization
%    Must be crossrefs to the adresses given in the
%    translations.txt file (add it there, if one is missing)
%    Example:
%      organization = org-ptv,
%  address
%    Optional: Must be crossrefs to the adresses given in the
%    translations.txt file (add it there, if one is missing)
%    Example:
%      address =      dusseldorf,
%  edition
%    Optional: Write down the edition
%    Example:
%      edition =      {2.},
%      edition =      {5.},
%  month
%    Optional: Must be crossrefs to the month given in the
%    translations.txt file
%    Example:
%      month =        feb,
%  url
%    Optional: Add an url.
%    Example:
%      url =          {http://biogeme.epfl.ch/doc/tutorialv13.pdf},
%  comment
%    Optional: add any comment you want
%    Example:
%      comment =      {balmermi: this is a very good one.},
