%  KEY-DEFINITION: ArentzeTimmermans_TRB_2006
%    (Author1|Author1Author2|Author1EtAl)[_(INDEX)]_(PROCEEDINGS-KEY)
%    PROCEEDINGS-KEY is the key defined for the proceedings the entry refers to.
%    Example:
%      ArentzeTimmermans_TRB_2006,
%      BalmerEtAl_1_STRC_2005,
%      BalmerEtAl_2_STRC_2005,
%  CROSSREF
%    MUST be the key of the proceedings to which the entry refers to.
%    Example:
%      CROSSREF = {TRB_2006},
%      CROSSREF = {STRC_2004},
%      CROSSREF = {STRC_2006},
%  AUTHOR
%    Must be crossrefs of authors given in the author.txt (add it there,
%    if one is missing)
%    Example:
%      AUTHOR =   Balmer # and # Raney # and # Nagel,
%  TITLE
%    Write the title in "Title-Style", the bib-style converts it.
%    If there are Characters which MUST be written as defined
%    (i.e. all-caps or no caps), then set those characters in
%    additional curly brackets.
%    Example:
%      TITLE =    {The Micro-Based Modeling System {OVID}},
%  URL
%    If an url exists for that specific paper, add it here.
%    Otherwise ALWAYS add an empty url.
%    Example:
%      URL =     {http://www.abc.org/the/path/to/the/paper.pdf},
%      URL =     {},
%  comment
%    Optional: add any comment you want
%    Example:
%      comment =      {balmermi: this is a very good one.},
